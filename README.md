# nwHacks 2022: BC COVID-19 Vaccination Registration Page

Hi! Welcome to our project. Our team consists of two members with no hackathon experience, but we have experience in design and decided to focus on that for our first run.

Our project is simple. We found the BC.GOV COVID-19 vaccination registration page to be 
difficult to siphon through, especially for elderly folk who are not as tech-savvy. We ourselves
also think we can make the web-page look slightly better and more effective. Our focus will be to make the design of the web-page more user-friendly, as well as mobile/desktop compatible. 

This is the original webpage for reference: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/covid-19/vaccine/register
