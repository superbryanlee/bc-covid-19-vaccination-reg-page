# nw_hacks_2022

Hi! Welcome to our project. Our team consists of two members with relatively little experience
in programming, but we have experience in design and decided to focus on that for our first hackathon.

Our project is simple. We found the BC.GOV COVID-19 vaccination registration page to be 
difficult to siphon through, especially for elderly folk who are not as tech-savvy. We ourselves
also think we can make the web-page look slightly better and more effective. Our focus will be to make the design of the web-page more user-friendly, as well as mobile/desktop compatible. That's the challenge we'll be tackling! 

This is the original webpage for reference: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/covid-19/vaccine/register

We have the bare-minimum experience with HTML/CSS/JS so that's what we're planning on honing with this
project. We don't plan on being competitive, but please do enjoy our project. Happy hacking.
